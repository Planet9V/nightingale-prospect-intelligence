## Objection Handling

### "We're too small for sophisticated threats"

**Response:** "Actually, you're a perfect target. Chinese APTs specifically target emerging hydrogen technology leaders before they scale. Your innovations today are worth billions tomorrow—threats actors know this. Air Liquide thought the same until their breach last year."

### "Security will slow our growth"

**Response:** "Poor security stops growth entirely—just ask the 60% of startups that don't survive a major breach. We design security that enables growth, not restricts it. Our approach with [similar client] actually accelerated their deployment timeline by building customer trust."

### "We can't afford enterprise security"

**Response:** "You can't afford not to have it. One ransomware incident averages $4.45M—more than your entire Series A target. We offer scaled solutions starting at $20K/month that grow with you. Plus, proper security can reduce insurance premiums by 40%, partially offsetting costs."

### "We'll handle security after Series A"

**Response:** "Series A investors now require mature security programs—it's a due diligence checkpoint. Starting now positions you for better terms and valuation. [Competitor] lost a $30M round due to security concerns discovered in diligence."

### "Our team can handle it internally"

**Response:** "Your team is world-class at hydrogen systems, not cybersecurity. Would you trust a cybersecurity company to design fueling stations? Partner with experts so your team can focus on what they do best—revolutionizing hydrogen infrastructure."

## Success Metrics

## Competitive Intelligence

### If They're Considering Competitors

**Vs. Generic IT Security Firms:**
"They don't understand hydrogen infrastructure. When minutes of downtime can cause catastrophic safety issues, you need OT specialists who understand your world."

**Vs. Large Consulting Firms:**
"They'll send junior consultants with PowerPoints. We send hydrogen infrastructure security experts who've protected systems handling 700 bar pressure and -253°C temperatures."

**Vs. Doing Nothing:**
"Nel ASA thought they were too small to target—until ransomware shut them down for two weeks. In hydrogen infrastructure, 'wait and see' is a strategy for failure."
