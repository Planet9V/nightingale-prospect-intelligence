## Data Point Counting

### What Counts as a Data Point
- Executive name and title (2 points)
- Financial metric with number (1 point)
- Vendor name and product (2 points)
- Specific date and event (2 points)
- Technology platform name (1 point)
- Project name and budget (2 points)
- Compliance requirement (1 point)
- Location or address (1 point)
- Percentage or ranking (1 point)
- Direct quote (2 points)

### What Doesn't Count
- Generic descriptions
- Category names without specifics
- Vague timeframes ("recently")
- Template placeholders
- Repeated information
- Boilerplate content

---

## Template Detection Rules

### Automatic Failure Patterns
These patterns result in immediate quality failure:

1. **Bracket Templates**: `[Company Name]`, `[Year]`, `[CEO Name]`
2. **Placeholder Text**: "Company Name", "various", "multiple", "numerous"
3. **Generic Content**: "industry standard", "typical challenges", "standard vendors"
4. **Incomplete Sections**: "TBD", "To be determined", "Information pending"
5. **Vague References**: "executives", "leadership", "management" without names

### Detection Methods
```bash
# Automated detection
grep -r "\[.*\]" prospect_directory/
grep -r "Company Name\|various\|multiple\|TBD" prospect_directory/

# Manual review triggers
- Files under 2KB size
- Sections with <5 data points
- Repeated generic phrases
```
